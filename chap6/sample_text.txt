ANKARA — Crowds of angry mourners marched in central Ankara on Sunday to denounce Turkish authorities a day after nearly 100 peace activists died in the worst terrorist attack in the country’s history. The twin bombings Saturday, which took place as thousands gathered for a peace rally, shocked the nation but also deepened divisions in a country already roiled by domestic and regional crises.

Turkish officials said they had launched an investigation into the attack, which they called an assault on “the unity of the country.” Opposition lawmakers condemned the authorities for failing to protect the demonstration, which was organized just weeks before the Nov. 1 general elections. At least 95 people were killed and more than 500 injured, the Health Ministry said. But local politicians said the remains of 120 victims had been identified.

On Sunday, members of parliament from Turkey’s ethnic Kurdish minority and pro-Kurdish People’s Democratic Party (HDP) clashed with police as they attempted to lay red carnations at the bomb site. The demonstrators chanted against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who they called a “murderer” in the wake of the attack, media reports said.

The End.
